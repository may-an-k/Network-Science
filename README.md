## Network science approaches to evaluating different types of networks to gain insights about how network structure and growth can determine real-world outcomes

## Description 
This repository contains techniques to analyse complex network structures like random and scale-free networks. Analysing network motifs and other metrics can give us key insights 
into the correlation and progression of the nodes themselves. It is a way to analyse the complexities that arise in systems via associations.

## Scripts
1. The Barabasi-Albert model for evaluating scale-free networks
2. Ravasz hierarchical clustering algorithm for community detection
3. Network Randomisation and Watts-Strogatsz model to show the small world property and high clustering of real networks

## Installation requirements 
- Python(3.7 or above)
- NetworkX (python library containing various network metric calculation tools)
- Gephi (visualisation)
