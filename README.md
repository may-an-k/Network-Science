## Network science approaches to evaluating different types of networks to gain insights about how network structure and growth can determine real-world outcomes
1. The Barabasi-Albert model for evaluating scale-free networks
2. Ravasz hierarchical clustering algorithm for community detection
3. Network Randomisation and Watts-Strogatsz model to show the small world property and high clustering of real networks
